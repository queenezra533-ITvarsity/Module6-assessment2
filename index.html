        <ul>Toyota Amarok</ul>
        <ul>The arrival of the more powerful 3.0 TDI will see the old 165kW version fall away, while the 103kW 2.0 TDI ,<br>
            and 132kW 2.0 BiTDI (twin turbo) will soldier on at the lower end of the range.<br>
            Not only does the 190kW TDI motor have 25kW more power than its predecessor,<br>
             but maximum torque also rises by 30Nm to total 580Nm from 1400 to 2750rpm. <br>
            There’s also an overboost function that liberates an extra 10kW during short <br>
            spurts of up to 10 seconds, which will come in handy when you’re overtaking.</ul>

        <ul>Merceded Benz G63</ul>
        <ul>The 2021 Mercedes-AMG G63 comes with a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine that makes 577 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque.<br>
             A nine-speed automatic gearbox with steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters sends all that power to the all-wheel-drive system (4Matic, in Mercedes marketing lingo).<br>
              Low-range gearing (2.93:1 reduction) is standard as are three locking differentials, allowing the G63 to scale steep dirt grades with ridiculous ease.<br>
               At our test track, the nearly 5800-pound G63 rocketed from zero to 60 mph in just 3.9 seconds.<br>
                Along with its extra power, the G63 has AMG-specific suspension tuning. Ride comfort is vastly improved versus older G-wagens, but given this SUV's towering height and off-road mission, you shouldn't expect much in the way of handling ability.<br>
                 And there's still quite a bit of wind noise at highway speeds. Properly equipped, the G63 can tow up to 6500 pounds.
